1. it handles small msg not well, when using the given checker for less than 3 bytes, it does not 
always send back the right string.

2. what is the point to timeout the select?

3. since we do not block and give a timeout to each send and recv we need to keep track that
whether this fd is for writing or reading right? However, since we can choose to write and not really block, we do not need to really timeout write?


do not keep the buffer forever
